## EXTERNAL CONTRIBUTIONS

- kadaan, joel.baranick:
  + Added a fix for a hadoop issue (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12169) which affects the s3a filesystem and results in duplicate files appearing in the results of ListStatus. In the process, extracted a base class for all FsHelper classes based on the hadoop filesystem.
