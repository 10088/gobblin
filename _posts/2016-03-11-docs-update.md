We are happy to announce the the Gobblin documentation has been migrated to a brand new system based on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) and [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). This means that our old documentation on the GitHub wiki is now deprecated and is no longer the source of truth for our documentation. The new documentation can be found here: http://gobblin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

This new system allows any user to create a Pull Request to update the documentation. The process for editing docs is the same for editing code. All documentation can be found under the `gobblin-docs` folder, and the master configuration file for documentation is `mkdocs.yml`.

The new system also allows for exciting new features such as full text search and automatically generated table of contents.

For more information on this new system please checkout the original [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/issues/724) and the [GitHub PR](https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/pull/788).
